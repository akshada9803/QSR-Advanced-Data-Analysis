# Data Analysis Project: From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to the Data Analysis Project repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to performing data analysis, ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques. It emphasizes the use of charts, advanced DAX measures, parameters, and Excel functions to derive meaningful insights from data.

### Project Overview

This repository demonstrates step-by-step data analysis with practical examples. It focuses on:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data structure, cleaning, and preparation.

* Data Visualization: Using various charts to represent data insights visually.

* Advanced Analysis Techniques: Implementing DAX measures, parameterized queries, and Excel functions.

* Business Insights: Deriving actionable insights from the data to inform decision-making.

### Features

###### 1. Data Preparation

 * Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicate data, and inconsistencies.

 * Data Transformation: Structuring data into dimension and fact tables.

 * Data Modeling: Creating relationships between datasets to enhance insight generation.

###### 2. Financial Performance Analysis

 * Key Metrics: Analysis of overall sales, gross profit, EBITDA, PAT (Profit After Tax), SKU trends, and YoY changes.

 * Trend Analysis: Evaluating sales and profit trends over time to identify patterns and anomalies.

 * Cluster Analysis: Sales bifurcation by geographic or demographic clusters.

###### 3. Chart Types and Their Meanings

 * Bar Charts: Comparing sales and cost metrics across different categories.

 * Waterfall Charts: Visualizing the contribution of various factors to total profits (e.g., Price-Volume-Mix Analysis).

 * Mekko Charts: Highlighting SKU contributions and their percentages.

 * Pareto Charts: Focusing on the 80/20 rule, identifying top-performing categories or items.

 * Scatter Plots: Gross Profit vs. Volume analysis.

###### 4. Optimization and Budgeting

 * Quadrant Analysis: Identifying high-impact and high-potential areas.

 * Variance Analysis: Comparing actual vs. budgeted performance.

 * Profit Maximization: Evaluating strategies to increase profitability based on SKU and pricing contributions.

###### 5. Advanced Techniques

 * Advanced DAX Measures:

 * Calculated columns and measures for deep insights.

 * Time intelligence functions for trend analysis.

 * Conditional calculations to analyze specific segments.

#### Parameters:

* Dynamic filtering of data.

* Interactive dashboards for customized views.

#### Excel Functions:

 * VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and advanced formulas for data transformation.

 * PivotTables and charts for summarizing and visualizing data.

#### Insights Derived

This project demonstrates the following:

 * Financial Insights: Clear understanding of profitability drivers and trends.

 * Optimization Areas: Identification of high-performing SKUs and categories.

 * Strategic Planning: Actionable recommendations based on budgeting and variance analysis.
